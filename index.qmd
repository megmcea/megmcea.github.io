*Leveraging data for evidence-based decision making*

I specialize in transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights. With expertise in **quantitative and statistical analysis**, I help organizations make informed, evidence-based decisions that stand up to scrutiny.

From **end-to-end analytical consulting** to strategic decision support, I work with clients to develop robust solutions tailored to their needs. Whether it’s optimizing resource allocation, assessing risk, or building predictive models, I provide the **evidence foundation needed for confident decision-making**.

As an **infectious disease subject matter expert** with training in disease transmission mechanisms, disease ecology, and social-ecological systems, I bring deep domain knowledge to the table, helping public health agencies, research institutions, and businesses navigate complex challenges with data-backed strategies.

Let’s turn your data into decisions that matter.
