    "text": "Helping conservation professionals make better decisions\nGiven decades of research advancing our knowledge of disease, invasive species, and other threats in our environment, why do we still struggle to apply these insights to meet conservation goals? Because decision-making is about more than just empirical science and quantitative data: these insights need to be leveraged and incorporated with the values and objectives of decision-makers to be meaningfully applied to solve real problems.\nI’m an ecosystem health professional dedicated to leadership at the intersection of science and decision making. I bring a range of quantitative skills in both ecological and socio-economic methods to support evidence-based policy and decision making for leaders in fisheries and wildlife conservation. Want to make better decisions that balance the needs of humans, animals, and the environment we all depend on? Let’s make something happen."
